**Why It Matters**: All modern high-performance systems run in containers, and performance measurement is critical for optimization decisions.

---

### Day 4: Data Structure Performance Explorer
**Goal**: Understand when to use different containers

**What You'll Build**: Systematic performance comparison of STL containers
- Compare std::vector, std::unordered_map, std::map, std::set for different operations

### Day 5: Real-Time Data Processor
**Goal**: Handle streaming data efficiently

**What You'll Build**: Mock data processor with real-time analytics
- Parse CSV stream of data records (timestamp, identifier, value, quantity)

## Learning Progression

Each day builds on the previous:

1. **Build Systems** → You can compile and distribute C++ code professionally
2. **Header Libraries** → You understand modern C++ distribution patterns
3. **Containers + Benchmarks** → You can measure and optimize performance
4. **Data Structures** → You make informed choices about algorithms and containers
5. **Stream Processing** → You can handle real-time data efficiently
6. **Concurrency** → You understand thread safety and parallel processing fundamentals

## Success Criteria

After completing all 6 projects, you should be able to:
- Set up a new C++ project with CMake and CI from scratch
- Design and implement header-only libraries
- Write and interpret performance benchmarks
- Choose appropriate data structures for different use cases
- Process streaming data efficiently
- Write thread-safe concurrent code
- Containerize C++ applications for deployment

## Next Steps

With these foundational skills mastered, you'll be ready to tackle more ambitious projects like:
- High-performance order book implementation
- Low-latency data processing systems
- Distributed system components
- Real-time analytics engines

## Daily Study Schedule
Each day should follow this pattern:
1. **Morning (2-3 hours)**: Read assigned materials for the day
2. **Afternoon (4-5 hours)**: Implement the project
3. **Evening (1 hour)**: Document learnings and prepare for next day

**Time Management**: Don't spend more than 3 hours on reading per day. The goal is practical competence, not theoretical mastery.

## Contributing

This is a learning repository. Each project should be:
- Completable in one focused day (6-8 hours)
- Well-documented with clear learning objectives
- Professionally structured with proper testing
- Incrementally building toward real-world skills

**Remember**: The goal isn't to build the most sophisticated system possible, but to develop the foundational competence that makes sophisticated systems achievable.
